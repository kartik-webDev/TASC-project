- ## 4.2 Why is the Project Important?

    - ## 🚨Problem Statement

        - In today’s fast-paced ride service industry, passenger comfort and safety are often compromised in favor of speed and efficiency. Many platforms lack a structured, meaningful feedback system that captures the rider’s full experience beyond just star ratings. As a result:

        - Passengers feel unheard or helpless in influencing driver behavior.

        - Drivers receive inadequate or vague feedback, limiting their ability to improve.

        - Platforms fail to identify and address patterns of poor service or risky behavior.

        - This gap results in declining trust, inconsistent ride quality, and unsafe travel experiences. 


    - ### ✅ TASC provide a simple solution.
    * #### Providing a passenger-first platform where riders can:

        - Give structured feedback after each ride

        - Help shape driver ratings and performance standards

        - Drive a culture of accountability and empathy in ride services

    ## Market need and opportunity


    - ## 📈 Market Need
        - ### 🚗1. Growing Reliance on Ride Services
            * Urban and semi-urban populations increasingly depend on ride-hailing apps (Ola, Uber, etc.) for daily commutes.

            - With convenience comes rising concern about passenger safety, comfort, and driver behavior.

        - ### 💬 2. Feedback Systems Are Surface-Level

            - Most ride apps use simple star ratings and generic comments, which often fail to capture the real quality of rides.

            - Passengers lack influence over the system once a ride ends — leading to dissatisfaction and distrust.

        - ### ⚠️ 3. Safety Incidents Are Underreported

            - Many passengers avoid reporting unsafe or aggressive behavior because the process is not easy or impactful.

            - There's a need for a dedicated, focused platform to report, analyze, and address such concerns.

    - ## 🪟 Market Opportunity

        - ### 🎯 1. Passenger-Centric Differentiation

            - TASC can fill the void by offering a dedicated platform for passengers to share in-depth feedback, influencing driver ratings and promoting safer driving practices.

        - ### 🌍 2. Integration with Existing Services

        - ### 🤝 4. Data-Driven Insights for Stakeholders

            - Aggregated feedback data can provide valuable insights for transportation authorities and service providers to implement targeted improvements and policies.
